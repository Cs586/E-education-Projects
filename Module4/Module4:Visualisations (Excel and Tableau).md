# Module 4: Visualisations (Excel and Tableau)

## Mission 4.1: Excel Pivot Tables and Charts
With your cleaned Google sheet, weâ€™re going to perform some functions to get additional data on the Udemy courses and consolidate and present this clearly. To do this, we will be using the Right/Left Function, IF function, VLookup and we will create Pivot Tables and Charts. 

1. **we want to know the date that each course was published without the time stamp. Use the Right or Left function to create a â€˜Dateâ€™ Column.**
2. **we want to understand how many beginner courses are free or paid. Create a column called â€˜Free Beginner Courseâ€™ and use the IF And Function to indicate whether a course is a Free Beginner Course or a paid course.**
3. **Your manager has asked for a list of the top 20 most subscribed courses. She has asked for**
    * **Their level**
    * **Whether they are free or paid,**
    * **Whether any are free beginner courses,**
    * **Duration of the course**
    * **The date they were published**
    **Use the VLookup function to find and organise this information on a separate sheet. She wants to understand the trends for the most subscribed courses.**
  
4. **Pivot Tables and Charts Create the following Pivot Tables and Charts:**
    * **Total number of subscribers for each subject (Pie Chart)**
    * **Average number of subscribers for each subject (Bar Chart)**
    * **Average cost per subject at each level (Bar Chart)**
    * **Average content duration for each subject (Bar Chart)**
    * **Average rating per subject for each level (Column Chart)**
    * **Any other data that you feel will be important to include in your analysis**
